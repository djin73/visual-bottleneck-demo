        <h2>wikiHow Hierarchy</h2>
        <p>
          When you're following instructions, you may want to see more detailed instructions about a step.
          In the terms of natural language processing, this reflects the hierarchical relationship among procedural events, where each step can have many sub-steps.
        </p>
        <p>
          This web demo accompanies our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07264" target="_blanks">ACL 2022 paper</a> and lets you explore the procedural hierarchy discovered from wikiHow.
          You can start with a random procedure by clicking <a href="/">"I'm feeling lucky"</a> or go for a particular one using the search bar.
          You can expand upon the steps when available to see more detailed instructions, which are predicted by our models with a confidence score.
